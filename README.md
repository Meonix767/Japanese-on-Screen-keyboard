# On-Screen Japanese Kana Keyboard

An on-screen Japanese kana keyboard that visually mirrors physical keyboard input to help users learn kana layouts while typing on a standard English keyboard.

## Project Overview

This project explores the idea of combining typing practice with visual feedback for Japanese learners. When active, the application displays an on-screen keyboard arranged in a Japanese kana layout. As the user presses keys on their physical keyboard, the corresponding on-screen key highlights in real time.

The goal is to make it easier for learners to associate physical key positions with Japanese kana, even when using a regular QWERTY keyboard.

## Current Status

🚧 Early development / prototype stage

The project currently focuses on:
- Building the on-screen keyboard interface
- Handling basic user interaction
- Establishing a clean and extensible project structure

More advanced features such as full keyboard input hooks and system-level integration will be explored later.

## Planned Features

- Visual Japanese kana keyboard layout
- Real-time key highlighting
- Physical keyboard input mapping
- Modular architecture for future expansion
- Potential C++ integration for low-level input handling

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Git for version control

## Motivation

This project is both a learning exercise and a practical tool. It is designed to deepen understanding of:
- GUI development
- Input handling
- Software architecture
- Systems-level thinking

## Notes

This project is being developed incrementally, with a focus on learning, clarity, and maintainable code rather than speed or feature completeness.
